## Problem 1. Personal Data

#### a. Data Summarizing

-   I can calculate the mean water usage on each day of the week, and compare those means to one another because I think I may use more water on certain days. Over the weekend I have more free time, so I think I will use more water (for example, taking longer showers, doing more laundry, etc.) on Saturday than other days of the week.
